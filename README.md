## SquirrelAttack

### Overview

SquirrelAttack is a game demo created for a GameJam with the theme: *Reverse Progress*. In this game, players embody the force of nature üå≥, seeking to reclaim villages constructed by humans üèòÔ∏è. The core gameplay revolves around commanding various animals üêøüêª to dismantle human settlements.

### Gameplay

#### Demo Version:
Players take on the role of nature, directly controlling squirrels and bears to attack human structures. The objective is to reclaim villages by destroying human buildings.

#### Full Game Features:
In the full version, players must strategically place factories within the forest part of the village to train animals and spawn them. Factories require nature points, which are earned by scaring away humans or reclaiming human buildings. Players must balance resource management with tactical decisions to succeed. The game also introduces a variety of new animals, each with unique abilities:

- **Birds**: Ideal for scouting, birds provide valuable intelligence about human activities and defenses.
- **Moles**: Mole units can dig trenches, providing cover for other animals and disrupting human movements.
- *And more*: Discover and utilize a diverse array of animal units, each with its own specialized role in reclaiming the land.
